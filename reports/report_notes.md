## Introduction
* For non-experts
* As general as possible: no technical details
* Anticipate the main points of the report
* Enthuse read about the project!
* The aim(s) or goal(s) of the project,
* The intended audience or “beneficiaries” of the work done,
* The scope of the project,
* The approach used in carrying out the project,
* Assumptions on which the work is based and
* A broad summary of important outcomes.

## Background
* Explain why the project is addressing the problem described in the report
* Show awareness of other relevant work (existing partial solutions, why they
  are not sufficient)
* Show problem has not been solved by anyone else
* Can describe sequence of events leading to present situation
* End section with clear statement of the research questions the project is
  trying to solve
* **Briefly** mention how project has changed from initial plan
* Give references, summarise references, and explain how they are relevant
* Don't give too much specific detail: leave to the references

## Approach/Specification and design

* Give picture of the 'system' in terms of what it is required to do
* High-level details on how work is designed to meet these requirements
* Constraints on the solution
* Describe system from several perspectives:
  * use cases
  * static architecture: how partitioned into modules etc
  * for each module:
    * user interface
    * how data flows
    * what algorithms are implemented
* diagrams (UML etc)
* justify decisions

* for theoretical work:
  * thorough description of problem
  * what is required in a solution
  * approach to finding solution

## Implementation

* Describe the realisation of concepts and ideas described in the approach
  section
* May include important, interesting or innovative pieces of code only
* Describe problems encountered when implementing, and how/to what extent they
  were overcome (e.g. complexity, over-ambitious aims)

## Results and evaluation

* Demonstrate the solution works
* To what extent were goals achieved
* Is code implemented correctly (unit test results in appendix)
* **Data** that shows solution is good, not opinions
* Strengths and weaknesses
* Negative but well-evaluated results are fine

## Future work

* ~ 1 page
* Weaknesses of finished solution, including things that are missing
* What could be done next, if more time were available
* Should provide a starting point for someone else to continue with

## Conclusions

* ~ 1/2 a page
* Overview of everything, but mainly the results
* Don't introduce any new material: only summarise and reiterate the main
  points of the reports

## Reflection on learning

* ~ 2 pages
* What has been learned?
* Discuss any project management issues
* Consider whether project has impacted assumptions and ideas for approach to
  future work
