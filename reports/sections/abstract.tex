\begin{abstract}

Given an input consisting of conflicting claims from multiple sources of
unknown trustworthiness and reliability, truth-discovery algorithms aim to
evaluate which claims should be believed and which sources should be trusted.
The evaluations of trust and belief should cohere with one another, so that a
claim receives a high belief ranking if it is backed up by trustworthy sources
and vice versa.
