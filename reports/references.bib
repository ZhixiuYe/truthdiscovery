    abstract = "In the era of big data, information can be collected from many
    sources. Unfortunately, the information provided by the multiple sources on
    the same object is usually conflicting. In light of this challenge, truth
    discovery has emerged and used in many applications. The advantage of truth
    discovery is that it incorporates source reliabilities to infer object
    truths. Many existing methods for truth discovery are proposed with many
    traits. However, most of them ignore the characteristic of object
    correlations in data and focus on static data only. Object correlations
    exist in many applications. In this work, we propose a probabilistic truth
    discovery model that considers not only source reliability but also object
    correlations. This is especially useful when objects only claimed by few
    sources, which is common for many real applications. Furthermore, an
    incremental truth discovery method that considers object correlations is
    also developed when data provided by multiple sources arrives sequentially.
    Truth can be inferred dynamically without revisiting historical data, and
    temporal correlation is considered for truth inference. The experiments on
    both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed
    methods perform better than the existing truth discovery methods."
