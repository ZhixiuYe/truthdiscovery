# TODO list

* Look into semi-supervised approaches (start with [18] in 2018 paper)
* Look at {2,3}-Estimates
* Literature review

## Data
* Perform tests on synthetic data with varying number of variables, sources,
  and source trust distributions
* Find an interesting real-world dataset, both 'supervised' and unsupervised
